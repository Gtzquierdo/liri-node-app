# liri-node-app
LIRI - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

To send requests I'll be using the acios package. APIs and Node packages that'll be used will be:
    Node-Spotify-API
    AXIOS
    OMDB API
    Bands in Town API
    Moment
    DotEnv
